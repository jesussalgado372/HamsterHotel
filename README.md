// Peer Review: Xavier-I like how everything looks my favorite is how you did the text box for check-in, out, because they way you made yours unlike the pro-type you gave it a little more information that made it stand out a little more with the ability to put a month, day, year, to also have a drop down menu on how many guests you will have instead of typing it out. I think for your over all project I could say that everything looks clean with the positions of everything, how much layering the images, text makes it look great especially on your mobile lay out is good, compacted very well. The one thing I would say to the one I think that was off is the font size as the pro-type had a Dosis,regular font but I fell like that a simple fix but beside that I think nothing else and that pretty much it for my review on your hamster hotel.
